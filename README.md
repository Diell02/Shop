# Shop

This project is a simple shop where the frontend is more in focus than the backend. It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The backend has not been completed, with PHP used mainly for retrieving/saving data from/to the database for login, register, and some texts. It includes more static data. 

For the frontend, HTML is used to create the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for validating login, register, and creating a slideshow.
